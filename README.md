# Spammer
Spammer -as the name itself suggests- is an spammer app for web and desktop instant messaging applications. Spammer coded in VBS so you can only use it on Windows systems. It is an kind of screen scrapper and uses the method "SendKeys" for spamming messages. When you run, it will ask for values to enter. First you need to enter the name of application.

For example if your using Discord app, enter discord.exe etc.

After that, you need to enter the message that will be spam. Then you need to enter the spam count and cooldown. Cooldown is the time between 2 mesagges and sending time. If your using whatsapp or discord and if your connection is fine, 250ms will be fine.

IMPORTANT: After spaming starts do not click anywhere or don't try to type. Wait untill spamming ends.

Hope you enjoy :D
